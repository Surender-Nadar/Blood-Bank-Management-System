# Blood-Bank-Management-System
This Project is made using SQL in my college days 

Description - Blood banks collect, store and provide collected blood to the patients who are in need of blood. The people who donate blood are called ‘donors’. The banks then group the blood which they receive according to the blood groups. They also make sure that the blood is not contaminated. The main mission of the blood bank is to provide the blood to the hospitals and health care systems which saves the patient’s life. No hospital can maintain the health care system without pure and adequate blood.

I have added code file and project file regarding the topic :)
